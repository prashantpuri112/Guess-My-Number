The designed is **Retro** inspired by the old 80s game.

As the name says the goal of this project is to simply guess a secret number which is between 1-20.

In the Input box we can type a number, then we click **Check!** And then on the right side we get message according to code conditions:

- If Guessed Secret Number is High than Actual, Display: **Too High!**

- If Guessed Secret Number is Low than Actual, Display: **Too Low!**

After each guess that we fail, the score decreases by one.

If the guess is correct we get **Correct Number!** message and the background turns green.

**Highscore** is another features of this small application. If we want to play again, we can simply click **Again!** button and it all resets everything except for the **Highscore.**

Highscore is kept cause if we are quicker in the another round, our Highscore will then become better.
